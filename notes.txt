Prior the financial crises of 2007 the aim of monetary policy was low stable inflation. This policy of inflation targeting was relatively uncontroversial, central banks manipulated the interest rate on funds provided to banks, the impact of the changes on the broader was straightforward and predictable and could be reliably quantified.\autocite[271]{joyce2012quantitative}
Most central banks adjusted these interest rates in response to a broad range of indicators, generally sticking to the principles laid out by the "Taylor Rules".\autocite[271]{joyce2012quantitative}

The economic orthodoxy prior to the financial crises was that monetary policy was a crude tool with which to promote financial stability, and as such it was better to avoid trying to predict where asset bubbles might be growing.\autocite[271]{joyce2012quantitative}
This view has come under scrutiny and many central banks now place more emphasis upon stability in addition to their commitment to controlling inflation.\autocite[271]{joyce2012quantitative}

Bit on the Taylor principle.

The pre-crisis orthodoxy called for central banks to clean up the aftermath of asset bubbles, rather than trying to prevent them, but recent developments have pushed the traditional tools of monetary policy beyond their limits.\autocite[272]{joyce2012quantitative}
Under the Taylor rules current conditions in many nations would actually call for negative interest rates, but market interest rates cannot be pushed beyond zero because at that point even cash offers better returns than interest-bearing assets.\autocite[272]{joyce2012quantitative}

Most central banks have responded by rapidly expanding their balance sheets by purchasing assets in the hopes of injecting more liquidity into the market.\autocite[272]{joyce2012quantitative}

Quantitative Easing or QE was first tested as a policy in Japan in the 1990s as the nation dealt with the aftermath of a devastating real estate bubble.\autocite[274]{joyce2012quantitative}
The name \emph{Quantitative Easing} was meant to indicate a shift in policy towards targetting quantity variables rather than just interest rates as the Bank of Japan began to purchase government securities from banks in order to boost their cash reserves.\autocite[274]{joyce2012quantitative}

When Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke initiated the first round of QE he chose to refer to the policy as "credit easing" in a failed attempt to avoid similar actions taken by the Bank of Japan.\autocite[465]{blinder2010quantitative}
Convention holds that the overninght interest rate - or federal funds rate - is a far more effective and reliable tool than QE.\autocite[465]{blinder2010quantitative}

The basic principle of QE is that even in a situation where the overnight rate - which is effectively risk less - is bound at zero, the central bank can still try to exercise monetary policy by manipulating interest rate spreads.\autocite[466]{blinder2010quantitative}
Both longer-term and higher-risk debt command interest premiums, so at least in principle as long as the central bank can reduce these premiums, it could still increase aggregate demand even in a situation where the lower bound is at zero.\autocite[466]{blinder2010quantitative}

One basic QE strategy is for a central bank to acquire longterm government securities or more risky assets in lieu of the more traditional short-term securities.\autocite[466]{blinder2010quantitative}

There are two ways for a central bank to fund these activities, either it could sell off its short-term securities, which would change the composition of its balance sheet, or it oculd create new currency which would increase the size of its balance sheet.\autocite[467]{blinder2010quantitative}

The Fed's first foray into QE started during early 2008 when the Fed started selling its short term Treasuries in exchange for less-liquid assets with the aim of reducing the premium placed on liquidity, especially given the panicked state of the overall financial markets.\autocite[467]{blinder2010quantitative}
By November of 2008 the effective Federal funds rate had been pushed to zero, and the Fed began to turn towards more QE as the Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet from \$907 on September 3rd, 2008 to \$2,214 billion on November 12th.\autocite[468]{blinder2010quantitative}

Much of this increase came from the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and other assets.\autocite[469]{blinder2010quantitative}

One important aspect of Quantitative easing is that the greatest effects of the policy can only be felt if investors see a credible commitment on the part of the central bank to keep interest rates low, even if the economy recovers and the Taylor rule prescribes increased interest rates.\autocite[4]{krishnamurthy2011effects}
The central bank could signal such a commitment through public statements, and more substantively, by purchasing large quantities of long-term assets during QE.\autocite[4]{krishnamurthy2011effects}

The belief that purchasing longer-term debt can reduce the duration premium rests upon the assumption that certain investors prefer bonds of particular maturities, and that other investors function as arbiters to determine the duration risk associated with debt.\autocite[5]{krishnamurthy2011effects}

%This is the principle of "preferred habitat demand"\autocite[]{krishnamurthy2011effects}

Starting during the 90s Japan suffered a lengthy recession and crippling deflation for more than a decade, prompting the Bank of Japan to introduce Quantitative easing on an unprecedented scale.\autocite[376]{kurihara2006relationship}

The Taylor rule is a principle, first proposed by John B. Taylor in 1993, that aims to approximate the target federal funds rate.\autocite[232]{woodford2001taylor}
The equation takes the form
\begin{displaymath}
i_t = 0.04 + 1.5{(pi_t -0.02) + 0.5(y_t - \bar{y}_t)
\end{displaymath}
where $i_t$ represents the target federal funds rate, $\pi_t$ is the inflation rate measured by the GDP deflator, $y_t$ is the log of real GDP, and $\bar{y}_t$ is the potential output.\autocite[232]{woodford2001taylor}

The European Central Bank began its own program of Quantitative Easing early in 2015.\autocite{economistQEGermany}
There is considerable concern that the policy will not be as effective in Europe as it has proven in the United States.\autocite{economistQEGermany}
Prior to Quantitative Easing, Europe had actually begun to enter deflation indicating that popular concern that the policy would lead to hyperinflation are largely irrational.\autocite{economistQEGermany}

The basic assumption of traditional monetary policy is that by altering interest rates a central bank can change asset prices so as to alter banks willingness to lend, and firms and individuals to invest and consume.\autocite[51]{fawley2013four}
