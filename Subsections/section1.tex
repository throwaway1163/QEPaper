The Taylor rule is a principle, first proposed by John B. Taylor in 1993, that aims to approximate the target federal funds rate.\autocite[232]{woodford2001taylor}
The equation takes the form
\begin{center}
$i_t = 0.04 + 1.5(pi_t -0.02) + 0.5(y_t - \bar{y}_t)$
\end{center}
where $i_t$ represents the target federal funds rate, $\pi_t$ is the inflation rate measured by the GDP deflator, $y_t$ is the log of real GDP, and $\bar{y}_t$ is the potential output.\autocite[232]{woodford2001taylor}
